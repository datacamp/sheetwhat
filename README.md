`sheetwhat` enables you to write Submission Correctness Tests (SCTs) for interactive Spreadsheet exercises on DataCamp.

- If you are new to teaching on DataCamp, check out https://instructor-support.datacamp.com.
- If you want to learn what SCTs are and how they work, visit [this article](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/courses/course-development/submission-correctness-tests) specifically.

## Installing

```
pip install sheetwhat
```

## Demo

Sheetwhat is typically used in a web application, but you can also experiment with its functions on your local machine.
SCT functions that fail will throw a `TestFail` error.

```python
# Setup: make all checking functions available
from sheetwhat.sct_syntax import SCT_CTX
globals().update(SCT_CTX)

# Setup: set up state with student data, solution data and SCT range
from sheetwhat.State import State
from protowhat.Reporter import Reporter
Ex.root_state = State(
    {'values': [["a", "a"]], "formulas": [["=B1"]]},
    {'values': [["b", "b"]], "formulas": [["=B1"]]},
    "A1",
    Reporter()
)

# Experiment interactively with SCTs
# Passes, as formulas at A1 match
Ex().has_equal_formula()

# Fails, as values at A1 do not match
Ex().has_equal_value()
```

## Testing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pytest
```
