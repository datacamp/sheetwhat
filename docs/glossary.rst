Glossary
--------

This article lists some example solutions. For each of these solutions, an SCT
is included, as well as some example student submissions that would pass and fail. In all of these, a submission that
is identical to the solution will evidently pass.

.. note:: 

    These SCT examples are not golden bullets that are perfect for your situation.
    Depending on the exercise, you may want to focus on certain parts of a statement, or be 
    more accepting for different alternative answers.

All these examples come from live Spreadsheets courses. You can have a look at the GitHub source of these courses as well.
